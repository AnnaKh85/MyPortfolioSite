## Portfolio Website ðŸ’¯

Portfolio for developers is a simple and minimalistic website to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Kevin Clark](https://kevinclark.ca).

# Pages

I've kept the pages as simple as possible. Only the required sections are included with minimal content.
